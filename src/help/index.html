<p>The <b>OpenHTS</b> is and open source hormone time series analysis package in Python. 
Currently supports various entropies such as Approximate entropy
(ApEn), Sample entropy(SampEn), Multiscale Entropy(MSE) and few
basic hormone pulse-detection algorithms. It also implements the
various HPA-axis models available in CellML format to create 
simulated time course patterns.</p>
